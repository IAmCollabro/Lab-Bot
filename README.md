# Lab-Bot
Hello there please read this before using the code!

The token is not valid. it does not link to any bots its just a example

This bot is open source. What does this mean?
I made this public for anyone to use!
I dont mind what it gets put to use for

some code may not work so please do not be mad at me
it was made with a command handler and will not work on a normal index page

If you need help with this code join my discord server https://discord.gg/fMvkzuN.
Once again this code is free for anyone to use and you do not have to credit me for it.

It was only a starter project
